## Technology 
- **Backend:** PHP

- **External APIs:** OMDb API for movie data
- **Development Environment:** XAMPP (Apache, MySQL)

## Installation Steps 
1. Clone the repository.
2. Move the project to your web server directory.
    - Place the `flick-fusion` folder inside your XAMPP `htdocs`
3. Set up the Database.
    -  Start the **Apache** and **MySQL** modules in your XAMPP Control Panel.
    -  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
    -  Create a new database and name it `flick_fusion`.
    -  Select the new `flick_fusion` database, go to the **"Import"** tab, and upload the `database/schema.sql` file from this project. This will create all the necessary tables.
4. Configure the API Key (Optional but Recommended).
    -  The project will work with a fallback API key for OMDb. For better performance, it is recommended to get your own free key from omdbapi.com.
    -  In the project's root directory, create a new file named `.env`.
    -  Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `your_key_here` with your actual key.
5. Run the application
    - You can now access the project by navigating to `http://localhost/flick-fusion/public/` in your browser.
