# Flick Fusion

Track and rate movies, compare with friends, and pick what to watch next.

## Quick start
- This repo starts empty. Weâ€™ll add pages: `index.html`, `login.html`, `my-ratings.html`, `friends.html`.
- Open issues for each feature and work in branches (`feature/<name>`).

## Tech (planned)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend). Optional backend later (PHP + MySQL or Node).
